<h3>I pledge to:</h3>
<ul class='pledge-points ecocheckbox'>
	<li>[checkbox* pledge1 use_label_element "Pledge1"]<h1 class="hl">Reposition practice in a way that considers wider ecological implications and consequences</h1>

How might we consider ecology and sustainability as part of our planning stages and ‘creative dreaming’? In what ways can thematic, aesthetic and environmental considerations be simultaneously explored from the beginning? Here we value: <strong>Responsibility</strong>

[expand title="Examples of this pledge point and value in action:"]
<ul class="ecocheckbox">
	<li>view the limitations in material and sources as a creative challenge</li>
	<li>work towards energy efficient touring schedules</li>
	<li>celebrate the ecological wins</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
</li>
	<li>[checkbox* pledge2 use_label_element "Pledge2"]<h1 class="hl">Consider local opportunities within a globalised context</h1>
How do we consider locality in the making, celebration and distribution of our work? Can we allow serendipitous and place-based responses to inspire and influence the artistic process rather than holding on to pre-determined ideas? How can we work with local people of different cultures in a way that also connects to the world at large? Here we value: <strong>Harmony</strong>

[expand title="Examples of this pledge point and value in action:"]
<ul>
	<li>create opportunities for local artists and communities to engage with international guests through social media platforms and public forums</li>
	<li>invite audiences to be creators rather than just passive watchers</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
</li>
	<li>[checkbox* pledge3 use_label_element "Pledge3"]<h1 class="hl">Challenge existing unsustainable practices, perceptions and assumptions</h1>
What might we do to start questioning and challenging unsustainable paradigms and processes? How can we begin to speak up about our ecological concerns? If there are no easy recipes ‘to do sustainability’, how do we learn from each project to find our way through the complexities? Here we value: <strong>Integrity</strong>

[expand title="Examples of this pledge point and value in action:"]
<ul>
	<li>state your ecological intentions with cast and crew</li>
	<li>initiate eco-labs to try new ways of doing things</li>
	<li>invite voices that are diverse in knowledge, ethnicity, and perspective</li>
</ul>
[/expand]</li>
	<li>[checkbox* pledge4 use_label_element "Pledge4"]<h1 class="hl">Explore opportunities for contribution as well as mitigation</h1>
How do we move beyond mitigation, efficiencies or ‘less bad’ consequences to create work that has positive legacies? What are some of the ways that we can give back to the community and broader ecology through our practice? Here we value: <strong>Respect</strong>
that it extends the boundaries of the self.

[expand title="Examples of this pledge point and value in action:"]
<ul>
	<li>inspire audiences so they are empowered to take action</li>
	<li>create stories where a community or the land or a species is the hero instead of an individual</li>
	<li>inform audiences of ecological ideas and strategies behind the work through Q&amp;A events and social media</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
</li>
	<li>[checkbox* pledge5 use_label_element "Pledge5"]
<h1 class="hl">Work together in advocating change</h1>
How do we encourage and support one another with mutual respect, tolerance and shared responsibility for nature’s resources? Can we work towards a less hierarchical model towards a collaborative process that endorses creativity instead of competition?

Here we value: <strong>Fellowship</strong> - actively in relationship with our world.
