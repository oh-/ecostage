<h3>I pledge to:</h3>
<ul>
<li><h1 class="hl">Reposition practice in a way that considers wider ecological implications and consequences</h1>
How might we consider ecology and sustainability as part of our planning stages and ‘creative dreaming’? In what ways can thematic, aesthetic and environmental considerations be simultaneously explored from the beginning? Here we value: <strong>Responsibility</strong>

	<li>Understand the you are not perfect but continuously ‘learning as you go’</li>
</ul>[/expand]</li>

<li><h1 class="hl">Consider local opportunities within a globalised context</h1>
How do we consider locality in the making, celebration and distribution of our work? Can we allow serendipitous and place-based responses to inspire and influence the artistic process rather than holding on to pre-determined ideas? How can we work with local people of different cultures in a way that also connects to the world at large? Here we value: <strong>Harmony</strong>

	<li>
<h1 class="hl">Challenge existing unsustainable practices, perceptions and assumptions</h1>
What might we do to start questioning and challenging unsustainable paradigms and processes? How can we begin to speak up about our ecological concerns? If there are no easy recipes ‘to do sustainability’, how do we learn from each project to find our way through the complexities? Here we value: <strong>Integrity</strong>

</ul>[/expand]</li>

<li><h1 class="hl">Explore opportunities for contribution as well as mitigation</h1>
How do we move beyond mitigation, efficiencies or ‘less bad’ consequences to create work that has positive legacies? What are some of the ways that we can give back to the community and broader ecology through our practice? Here we value: <strong>Respect</strong>
